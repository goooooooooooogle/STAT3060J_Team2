This picture shows the total ratios of click times of functions from 2022/09/01 - 2022/12/29.

It's obvious that "疫情防控" function has the largest ratio (71.9%).

And other functions such as "便民服务" and "你呼我应" both have a ratio less than 20%.

Therefore, we can find that residents use these functions infrequently.

This picture shows ratios of click times of functions in different versions.

In this picture, we can make several conclusions:

- For "疫情防控" function, Click-through rate (CTR) gradually decreases.
- For "你呼我应" function, CTR is always in a low level.
- For "便民服务" function, CTR gradually increases in the later versions.

In this picture, we use Click Times Per Day (CTPD) as a variable.

We can find that CTPD increases slowly at first, but becomes soon in version 3-5, and then gradually decreases in the later version.

Assume that the residents are required to use functions like "疫情防控" or have needs to use these functions.

Then we can find that the functions are only used frequently when residents are required to use.

In general, the functions do not meet the needs of residents' daily life.

This is another picture to show the trend of CTR of functions in different versions.

The law which is shown in this picture is similar to the analysis above.

## Conclusion

Through the above analysis, it becomes clear that:

- The status quo can be problematic, since "疫情防控" function becomes useless in the post-epidemic era.
- We need to develop other functions to meet the needs of residents better.

## Constructive advice
