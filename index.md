{: .no_toc }
- STAT3060J Computational Thinking with Data (2023 WP)

## Brief Introduction
In this project, we are going to use tools like python to analyse data of WenXuJinShan official account. And try to find a practicable way to optimize 
the function of this official account. Besides function optimization, we also attempt to propose some suggetions that can help this official account 
attract more subscription.

### Perspectives that We Concern
- Dissemination channels
- The relationship between article's topic and its attraction
- The function of WenXuJinShan official account
- The users' preferences of articles' contents

### Why these?
Let's take a closer look at factors to the number of followers.

    Operation-->Functions
    Factors-->Preferences_of_followers
```
`Preferences_of_followers` `Functions` `Contents` `Channels` are four factors that can be easily quantified. Also, these can be analysed through our data.

### Various Approaches
